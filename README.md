Run the code in project-setup/setup-exampleSept6.R to create local Excel files for your session.

Upload these files to a Google Drive folder and change the Excel files to Google Sheets.

*we will automate the upload and storing as Google Sheets in a future revision*

In the global.R file you will need to specify the Google Drive folder as folder_path3.
